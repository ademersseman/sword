Included in this repository is the source code to [superballs.lol](https://superballs.lol)! A Fun multiplayer game inspired by similar browser games [slither.io](slither.io) and [agar.io](agar.io). In this game you play as a ball centered in the middle of your browser screen with a 'sword' rotating about your center, your goal is to rise in the leaderboard by slashing other balls with your sword and to avoid getting slashed yourself!
